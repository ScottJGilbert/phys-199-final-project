# Python Logic Module

This directory contains the core Python logic for the quantum mechanics game.

## Purpose

- Independent of Blender/UPBGE for easier testing
- Contains quantum mechanics calculations
- Physics simulations
- Game state management

## Structure

Add your Python modules here following these principles:
- Keep functions pure and testable
- Use type hints for better code quality
- Document complex algorithms

## Example Module Structure

```python
# quantum_state.py
"""Module for quantum state management."""

class QuantumState:
    """Represents a quantum state."""
    pass
```

## Testing

Write corresponding tests in `tests/unit/` for each module.
