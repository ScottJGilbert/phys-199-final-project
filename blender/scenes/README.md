# Blender Scenes

This directory contains Blender scene files (.blend) for the game.

## Purpose

Store all Blender scene files here, organized by:
- Levels/stages
- Menus
- Test scenes
- Asset libraries

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names:
- `level_01_intro.blend`
- `menu_main.blend`
- `test_quantum_visualization.blend`

## Best Practices

1. Keep scenes organized and well-named
2. Use Collections to organize objects
3. Save regularly and use version control for .blend files
4. Document complex scenes with text datablocks in Blender
